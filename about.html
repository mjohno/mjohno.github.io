<h1>About MJohno</h1>

</ul>
<p>I am a Software Engineer and Leader specialising in DevOps, Site 
Reliability Engineering (SRE) and Cyber Security. I am currently working as an
SRE Lead for a Managed Service Provider, running mobile game back-ends on the
public cloud.</p>

<h2>My Niche</h2>

<p>With 10 years of experience in Infrastructure and IT Operations I know how to
successfully architect, deploy, maintain, secure and operate infrastructure
and services at scale, and additionally lead a team to do so.</p>

<h2>My Edge</h2>

<p>Information Technology needs to support the business' goals, not the other
way around. I know how to balance the availablity, cost and security trade-offs
associated with IT infrastructure to meet business goals whilst maximising
business outcomes. Being an effective communicator, I can bridge the gap
between business and technology.</p>

<h2>Technical Expertise</h2>

<p>A list of technologies and domains I am good with:</p>

<ul>
  <li> Programming (Python)</li>
  <li> Configuration Management (Ansible, Chef)</li>
  <li> Operating Systems (Linux)</li>
  <li> Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)</li>
  <li> Public Cloud (Amazon Web Services/AWS, Google Cloud Platform/GCP)</li>
  <li> VM Imaging (Packer)</li>
  <li> CI/CD (Jenkins)</li>
  <li> Source Code Management (Git, SVN)</li>
  <li> Linux Containers (Docker)</li>
  <li> Container Orchestration (Kubernetes, Docker Compose)</li>
  <li> Log Aggregation (Graylog, Splunk, ElasticSearch)</li>
  <li> Monitoring and Alerting (Telegraf, Prometheus, Grafana)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Random Stuff</h2>
